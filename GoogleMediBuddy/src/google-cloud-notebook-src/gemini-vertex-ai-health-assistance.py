You can create custom messages for each stage of the toilet routine.  This option is incredibly affordable and can be easily customized.
* **Visual Cues:**  Use clear visual aids like color-coded stickers, arrows, or pictures to guide individuals through the process.  Placement of these cues can be tailored to individual needs and preferences.
